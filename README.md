# holbertonschool-system_linux

This repository contains a collection of different projects related to systems
programming, specifically focused on Linux systems. The projects are written in
a variety of languages, primarily in C, but also Assembly, Makefile, Python, and
Shell scripts.

# Projects

Below is a brief description of some of the projects in this repository.

## 0x00-CPython

This project is an exploration of CPython, the reference implementation of the
Python programming language. CPython, written in C, is the most widely used
implementation of Python. This project aims to use knowledge of C to explore
Python's internals, offering a unique perspective on what makes Python such an
accessible and user-friendly language.

## 0x00-readelf

This project involves understanding and parsing the ELF (Executable and Linkable
Format) file format using C structures. Some of the learning objectives include
understanding what the ELF format is, what kinds of files are in the ELF format,
and what information is present in the file and sections header tables.

## 0x00-signals

This project deals with signal handling in Linux. The learning objectives
include understanding what signals are, why they exist, how they are delivered,
and how to set up a handler for a signal.

## 0x01-ls

This project involves re-implementing the ls command in C.

## Others

The repository contains several other projects related to different aspects of
Linux system programming. Each project directory may contain its own README with
more specific details about the project.
